## Whats Working

### CPU

Work fine, thanks to CPU friend and CPU FriendFriend, Patched to 0.8 Ghz (Min) - 2.4 Ghz (Max)
Using CPU Friend data provider on lowest power consumsion.
For me, no serious Performance Effect on this setting<br>
Great for Daily usage, such as office, sone video editing, graphic design, some multitask, of course browsing.
if you want to change the power setting,<br>
i will give the further assistance on the "other tweaks" section
