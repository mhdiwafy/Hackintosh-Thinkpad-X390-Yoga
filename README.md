## Whats Working ✅

### CPU 🧠

Work fine, thanks to `CPU friend and CPU FriendFriend`, Patched to 0.8 Ghz (Min) - 2.4 Ghz (Max)
Using CPU Friend data provider on lowest power consumsion.
For me, no serious Performance Effect on this setting<br>
Great for Daily usage, such as office, sone video editing, graphic design, some multitask, of course browsing.<br>
on the efi, i insert the `Performance profile` as default<br>
if you want to change the power setting,<br>
i will give the further assistance on the "other tweaks" section

Bluetooth functioning partially, the Wi-Fi is also work, but with some issue <br>
if you are using `Airportitlwm.kext`, the wifi speed will drops whenever connected to the bluetooth device, and It's hard to connect a Bluetooth device when you're on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi.<br>
